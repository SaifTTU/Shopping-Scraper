# Shopping-Scraper

Hello! This is our Grocery Shopper App! \
To run this, simply open up Grocery_UI_App in your favorite IDE and hit run. 
Download this whole folder if you haven't, then run the JavaFX App to use our prototype.
If you just want a demonstration of the scrappers, similarly open main.

Currently: You can add, remove, and reset list.

You can also hit the compare buttom and our interface will automatically run the scrapper programs necessary to find the prices online for MarketStreet and Walmart. 

And it will add the totals of each store, if the price was not already found in the database. 

In which case it will not run the scraper, and will instead add from the database. 

Combining these features really improves speed and versatility.

Bellow you will find our HTML Scrapers In Action.

This is an example of the Database Reader that was later added to store the values of previously searched items:

Heres a Photo of Our Database: \
Each of us found one of the 4 Primary lists in this database. We then added the functionality of the growing database in the "Added" Section. 
\
\
Additionally, at this time, while we get our Target Scraper to work, in order to use Target, a maintainer is required, a second person, who will go into the database.txt, and manually enter in the prices for Target for comparison.

As you can see, the more you use this app, the better it will get. Each time you enter in an item, the software scrapes the internet for its prices. These prices will be recorded, allowing you to have an ever expanding list. Right now the size of the list is limited to an array of size 500.

In the future, we'd hope to expand this by allowing past prices to be updated, and increases the number of stores.

We hope you have enjoyed this demonstration of our Grocery Comparison App!
